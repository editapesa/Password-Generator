# JavaScript: Password Generator

Employees with access to sensitive data want to randomly generate a strong password that provides greater security. I have modified the JavaScript code initially provided to include the following changes for an easy to navigate, clean and polished user experience.

- When clicking on the button to generate a password, a series of prompts are presented for password criteria.
- When prompted for password criteria, the user selects which criteria to include in the password.
- When prompted for the length of the password, the user selects a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters.
- When prompted for character types to be included in the password, the user chooses lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.
- When answering each prompt, the input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected.
- When all prompts are answered, a password is generated that matches the selected criteria.
- When a password is generated, the password is written on the page.
